# 🚗 Breaking Down Accidents

An analytical deep dive into accident data to uncover key causes, trends, and patterns—supporting actionable insights for road safety improvement.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Identify common factors contributing to road accidents.
- Quantify the role of environmental vs. human-related causes.
- Visualize accident patterns using Python-based tools.
- Recommend preventive measures based on data analysis.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **60%+** of accidents occur in **normal weather conditions**.
- Nearly **70%** happen during **daylight**.
- About **75%** occur on **dry road surfaces**.
- Human behavior—**speeding** and **distraction**—is a leading cause.
- Environmental conditions are less significant compared to driver-related errors.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data analysis
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add geospatial accident mapping.
- Analyze time-based trends (e.g., rush hours, weekends).
- Build predictive models for accident severity classification.
